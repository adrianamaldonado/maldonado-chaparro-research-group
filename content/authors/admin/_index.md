Adriana is a professor of Behavioral Ecology and Experimental Design at Universidad del Rosario. She is interested in understanding how social relationships form and are maintened, how group living species respond to variation in their social and ecological environment, how environmental perturbations affect the stability of social relationships, and how variation in social behavior can drive changes in group and population dynamics. I’m also interested in improving science transparency and literacy, that is why I now serve in the [PCI Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/). ​
